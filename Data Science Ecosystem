In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.
Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
1. Python
2. R
3. SQL
4. Julia
5. Scala
6. Java
7. C++
8. MATLAB
9. SAS
10. Ruby

Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
1. NumPy
2. pandas
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. scikit-learn
6. TensorFlow
7. PyTorch
8. Keras
9. statsmodels
10. NLTK

Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
1. Basic Arithmetic 
result = 5 + 3 * 2
print(result)  # Output: 11

2. Parentheses 
result = (10 + 5) / 2
print(result)  # Output: 7.5

3. Exponents 
result = 2 ** 3
print(result)  # Output: 8

4. Floating-Point Division 
result = 10 / 3
print(result)  # Output: 3.3333333333333335

5. Integer Division (Floor Division):
result = 10 // 3
print(result)  # Output: 3

This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
result = (3 * 4) + 5
print(result)  # Output: 17

This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
print(hours)  # Output: 3.3333333333333335

Objectives of Data Science
- Extract insights from large and complex datasets.
- Develop predictive models for making accurate forecasts.
- Discover patterns and trends in data to support decision-making.
- Enhance business processes and operations through data-driven strategies.
- Communicate findings effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
